# Death Toll
Now death has consequences, but without the inventory management tedium!
Will set keepInventory, but in exchange, each death will add debt and if you die with a toll unpaid it will wipe your inventory.
Breaking spawners will pay a part of the toll as well as give back one of the lost items, with a limit of 3 deaths paid in advance. Default is 12 spawners per death.

There is a difficulty setting to change the amount and some extra features.

Reprimand: 6 spawners, only removes the hotbar and equipped items. Gives Resistance when in debt.

Challenge(default): 12 spawners.

Ordeal: 18 spawners. Does not give back items.
