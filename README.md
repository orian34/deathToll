# deathToll
Now death has consequences, but without the inventory management tedium!
Will set keepInventory, but in exchange, each death will add debt and if you die with a toll unpaid it will wipe your inventory.
Breaking spawners will pay a part of the toll, to a limit of 3 deaths paid in advance. Default is 10 spawners per death.
